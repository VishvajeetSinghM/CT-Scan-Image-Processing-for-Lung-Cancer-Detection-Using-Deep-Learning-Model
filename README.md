# CT-Scan-Image-Processing-for-Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Model
Developed a lung cancer detection model using CNNs, SVM, and VGG16 with transfer learning. Implemented a stacking meta-model ensemble combining class probabilities from CNN and SVM for improved accuracy. Applied data preprocessing, feature scaling, and image augmentation to enhance model performance.
